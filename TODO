Yet Another Radius Daemon (YARD RADIUS) TODO list
-------------------------------------------------

My personal todo list for YARD RADIUS follows, rigorously unordered :-)


* Integration of some interesting features stolen from other free
  servers like Cistron Radius.

* Radtest needs to be extended to test accounting also. I think this
  is a very urgent thing. But I'm damned lazy.

* Logging messages need to be revised IMHO. Possibly it should use
  gettext library for international support.

* More work is needed for PAM, with some example modules to read/write data 
  in relational databases

* I like POSIX compliant sources, so a deep checking of functions and
  header files is required ASAP. 

* Separate passwd file should be in GDBM format to allow a fast loading.

* A YARD groups file should be introduced along with the alternate passwd
  file, in GDBM format and without known size limits of standard
  /etc/group file (i.e. 512 chars for compatibility with NIS).

* radwatch and radtest are far from being complete and debugged :-(
  Moreover I think their coding style is horrible.

* A new/additional file format should be considered instead of GDBM, 
  such as Berkeley DB. GDBM maintainment seems currently dismissed.

* A deep analysis of contributed libraries should be conducted in order 
  to start a re-organization in modules with dynamic loading by dlopen().

* A multithreading implementation should be attempted whenever possible.
  Many flavor of Unix are currently POSIX multithreaded and this could
  scale better.

* An UDP wrapper could be implemented in order to filter clients by ip
  address.

A very long list, as you can see ...
